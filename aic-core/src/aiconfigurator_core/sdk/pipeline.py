"""Pipeline-parallel (PP) modeling, split into layout and schedule.

Before this module, PP was modeled as an ideal linear speedup: a step's
latency was the *whole* model's latency (``_num_layers`` is never divided by
``pp_size``) and throughput was simply multiplied by ``pp_size``. That is
exact only when every stage costs the same and the pipe is always full.

Both assumptions break in practice:

* **Stage imbalance.** A pipeline advances at ``max_i(t_i)``, not
  ``avg_i(t_i)``. The un-sharded ``lm_head`` sits alone on the last stage, so
  for a decode step it makes that stage the critical path. Qwen3-32B at
  ``pp=8`` decodes at ~83% of the ideal cycle -- i.e. ~6.7x, not 8x.
* **Uneven layer split.** ``num_layers % pp_size != 0`` used to emit a warning
  saying "we're nothing to correct this". The cycle is set by the *fattest*
  stage, so 64 layers over pp=6 costs 11/10.67 of the even split.
* **Pipe starvation.** With fewer in-flight microbatches than stages, some
  stages idle every cycle.

Two layers, deliberately separated
----------------------------------

:class:`PipelineLayout` -- **where the work lives**: it owns the *rules*
(which op belongs to which stage, how many layers each stage gets) and derives
per-stage compute times and the per-hop link cost from them. Pure geometry
plus cost lookup, no scheduling policy.

:class:`PipelineSteadyState` -- **how the pipe runs**: microbatch count, P2P
overlap, cycle time, and the closed-form ``balance_factor`` / ``fill_factor``.

The split keeps the rules in one place so that a second derivation from them
(slicing the op list per stage, say) cannot drift from ``stage_times``. It
also keeps the two kinds of claim apart: the layout is a statement about the
model, while the factors are a steady-state *collapse* that holds only
because AIC evaluates one step shape and assumes every stage sees it. Anything
that models per-stage occupancy directly derives those effects itself and must
not also apply the scalars.

Scope: this is wired into ``run_agg``. The compiled-engine path the Dynamo
planner and Mocker use (``ForwardPassPerfModel`` -> ``forward_pass_time_ms``
-> ``rank_latency_ms``) does not enter ``run_agg`` and is still ideal-PP; see
the known-gaps section of ``docs/PIPELINE_PARALLEL_MODELING.md``.

This all lives in **orchestration**, above the op layer: it consumes the
per-op latency breakdown the step model already produces. No op query math
changes, so the Rust engine-step parity surface (see
``.claude/rules/rust-core/parity.md``) is untouched and both engines benefit.

``pp_size == 1`` always yields ``balance_factor == fill_factor == 1.0``
exactly, so single-stage results are bit-identical to the previous model.
