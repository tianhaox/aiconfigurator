"""
PerformanceResult class for backward-compatible latency+energy tracking.
"""


class PerformanceResult(float):
    """
    Float-like class that stores both latency and energy.

    Behaves exactly like a float for backward compatibility, but stores energy
    instead of power internally. Power is derived as energy / latency.

    Supports all arithmetic and comparison operations for full float compatibility.

    Units:
        - latency: milliseconds (ms)
        - energy: watt-milliseconds (W·ms) = millijoules (mJ)
        - power: watts (W) - derived property

    Note: 1 W·ms = 1 mJ. We use W·ms to match latency units (ms).
          To convert to Joules: divide by 1000 (J = W·s = W·ms / 1000)

    Example:
        result = PerformanceResult(10.5, energy=3675.0)  # 10.5ms latency, 3675 W·ms energy
        print(result)           # 10.5 (acts like float)
        print(result.energy)    # 3675.0 (energy in W·ms = 3.675 J)
        print(result.power)     # 350.0 (derived: 3675.0 / 10.5 = 350W)

        # Comparisons work correctly
        if result > 10.0:  # Uses __gt__
            print("Latency exceeds threshold")

        # Aggregation with sum()
        results = [result1, result2, result3]
        total = sum(results)  # __radd__ handles sum() start value
        print(total.energy)   # Energy is preserved

        # Sorting works based on latency
        sorted_results = sorted(results)
